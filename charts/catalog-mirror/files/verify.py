"""helm test: read the mirror through its Service the way swiss and helm do.

  - status.json: the last sync round succeeded for both halves;
  - catalog: every version file index.json names is served and matches its
    sha256 digest (swiss refuses a version whose digest does not match);
  - charts: index.yaml names its archives by relative name (so helm fetches
    them from the mirror, not from upstream), and every archive is served
    and matches a digest in the index;
  - a path that does not exist is a 404, so a catch-all answer cannot pass.
