# catalog-mirror

An in-cluster copy of the [model catalog](https://github.com/modelsphere/model-catalog)
and of this helm chart repository, for clusters whose route to GitHub is slow or
unreliable. [swiss](../swiss) is then pointed at the cluster instead of GitHub Pages.

| path | content | default upstream |
|---|---|---|
| `/model-catalog/` | `index.json`, every version file it names, perf reports | `https://modelsphere.github.io/model-catalog/` |
| `/helm-charts/` | `index.yaml` (archive URLs rewritten to relative names) and every chart archive | `https://modelsphere.github.io/helm-charts/` |
| `/status.json` | result of the last sync round | |

## Install

The cluster this is for may be the one that cannot read the published chart
repository, so install from a checkout of this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/modelsphere/helm-charts
helm install catalog-mirror ./helm-charts/charts/catalog-mirror -n swiss-system
helm test catalog-mirror -n swiss-system
```

The pod becomes Ready once the first sync has published both indexes.
`helm test` then reads the copy through the Service the way swiss and helm do:
every catalog version file matches the digest the index pins, every chart
archive is served and matches a digest in `index.yaml`, and a missing archive
is a 404. It also fails when the **last sync round** failed (status.json), even
though the copy keeps serving: a mirror that no longer follows its upstream
should show up red. The message names the half and the upstream error; once
the upstream is reachable again the next round (within
`sync.retryIntervalSeconds`) clears it.

Then, in the swiss site profile (the `swissd-profile` ConfigMap, re-read within a
minute; the install notes print these URLs for your release):

```yaml
chartRepo: http://catalog-mirror.swiss-system.svc/helm-charts
catalogs:
  - name: default          # keep the name existing releases recorded in their plans
    url: http://catalog-mirror.swiss-system.svc/model-catalog/
    default: true
```

Plain `http://` works for both: swiss treats a chartRepo that is not `oci://` as a
classic helm repository.

## How it works

One pod: **nginx** serves the volume, **sync** (`files/sync.py`, Python standard
library only) refreshes it every `sync.intervalSeconds` (300). Both images are
stock upstream images; the script and the nginx config ship in the chart.

- **Verified copies.** Version files are checked against the sha256 digest the
  catalog index pins; chart archives against the digests in `index.yaml`. A
  mismatch fails the round.
- **Never a half-updated index.** An index is replaced (atomic rename) only after
  every file it names is on disk and verified. A failed round changes nothing and
  the previous complete copy keeps serving; the next try is
  `sync.retryIntervalSeconds` (120) later.
- **Cheap when nothing changed.** The last ETag of each index is kept on the volume
  and sent as `If-None-Match`; a 304 ends that half of the round without touching
  the disk.
- **Incremental, never deletes.** Files already present with the right digest are
  not fetched again; catalog versions and chart releases are immutable.
- **Flaky upstream.** Network errors, 5xx and 429 are retried with backoff; other
  4xx are not.

The copy lives on a PVC (a few MB today), so a restarted pod serves the last copy
at once. The chart's PVC is kept on `helm uninstall` (`persistence.keep`); to reuse
an existing one, set `persistence.existingClaim`.

## Values worth knowing

| value | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `upstream.catalogUrl` / `upstream.chartsUrl` | GitHub Pages | what is mirrored; `chartsUrl` may be any classic helm repository, with absolute archive URLs (chart-releaser) or relative ones (ChartMuseum, Harbor) |
| `sync.intervalSeconds` | `300` | seconds between rounds |
| `sync.extraEnv` | `[]` | e.g. `HTTPS_PROXY` when GitHub is reachable only through a proxy |
| `image.nginx` / `image.python` | `docker.io/library/{nginx:1.27-alpine,python:3.12-alpine}` | point at a mirror if the cluster cannot pull from Docker Hub |
| `persistence.*` | 2Gi, cluster default class | `enabled: false` uses an emptyDir (full re-sync on restart) |
